Orbital Clock
This project is based on a love for astronomers and everything they have accomplished. Designed around kitty terminal, it is a simple clock that also shows a current relative position of the earth by using an
array of characters that is constantly printing to create a dynamic effect on the stars. Future plans for this project are to address compatibility with other terminals as well as a redraw to include the entirety
of the solar system.

**USAGE**
Simply navigate to the hidecodehere directory and input: ./AlphaLaunch
