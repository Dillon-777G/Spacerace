# Spacerace
This is a simple orbital clock based on my interests in space and cozy ui programs. I still have some work to do on getting the window to pop up correctly but for now It will give you a rough approximation of where
you are in the path of earths orbit currently and what the season is. I plan to implement some random space facts and stories about how the changing of seasons has been celebrated throughout history. It's very simple
in design, not too many bugs are even possible.
